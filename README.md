# DeformableNozzlesAnalysis
Image/Data analysis code for semester 7 mphys project "Spraying through deformable nozzles" 2025

## Pressure-Volume 

## Pressure-Velocity 
- All images are assumed to have been taken during the same session, so one folder for calibration is included

## Spray-Character
- different images are split into dated 'sessions' that can have their own calibration images, to account for multi day result taking
- Image folders are formatted as 'type-of-resin,number'/'pressure,iteration', so g1/1.5b2 refers to images taken at 1.5b for the first g type nozzle (green resin) at the 3rd iteration (indexed from 0, so 2)
